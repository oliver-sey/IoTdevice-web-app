This is a web app that we created with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node - we didn't use React), which is connected with users' IoT heartrate sensor devices, we developed one using a board similar to Arduino. Once they login, users can see their heartrate and blood oxygen percentage data, statistics about the data, edit their profile details, and more. Our site has a nice UI using CSS and some Bootstrap components, which is responsive for mobile and tablet screen sizes as well.
